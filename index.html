              <h2>A Clean Sweep</h2>
              <p>August 24, 2020</p>
              <div>
                <p>
                  After losing 3 out of 4 to the Dodgers, the M’s complete a 3
                  game sweep of the Rangers. The word on the street? Kyle Lewis
                  (and the name Kyle). But also how about that starting pitching
                  and bullpen? The bullpen only gave up 1 (!!) run in the 3 game
                  series. We’ll have to see if this remains sustainable, but
                  from the 3 games things are looking good, at least for the
                  future. Indeed, the future looks exciting, even if the team
                  misses out on Kumar Rocker.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ideally, this season would be a major success if our youth
                  could rake/pitch well AND we lose enough to draft Rocker.
                  Blowpen time baby.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Next opponent: San (Slam) Diego for the Vedder Cup.

                  Another week of being at home. Been checking out the new
                  update released recently in GTA Online.

                  Yacht missions are fun enough, and the captain outfit (was
                  bugged for me and had to contact Rockstar Support to get it)
                  is nice. Cars are cool but as usual, are very overpriced. Not
                  a bad filler update with QOL (quality of life) updates. The
                  real hype train is heading towards the “biggest update ever”
                  in December.

                  Also playing Bloons TD 6. Apparently I got into the top 25% in
                  the recent race. Quite proud of that considering I’m not the
                  best at the game and play casually.

              <div>
                <p>
                  Starter pitches 6 innings of 1 R/0 ER baseball. Offense scores
                  4. Bullpen comes in and gives up 6 runs.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Again, the team seems to be confused on whether they should be
                  FUBAR for Kumar or chasing one of those expanded postseason
                  slots. Record: 7-13 and currently the 3rd worst team in the
                  league by win percentage. Another week, starting pitching
                  looking good, offense shifting between scoring runs and
                  getting shutout, and bullpen being the blowpen.

                  Stuck at home with no clear date when everything will return
                  to normal again. That's been the story for the past few months
                  as time continues its march towards the end of 2020. I miss my
                  favorite Japanese restaurant and their bento boxes for $13.25.

                  It's going to be a while before I start traveling again. With
                  how many countries are banning US passport holders it'll
                  probably be until a working vaccine is out.

                  Looking on the somewhat bright side, Mariners baseball has
                  returned. 12 games through, a 4-8 record and a team that
                  doesn't know whether it wants to end the 18-year postseason
                  drought or FUBAR for Kumar. Starting rotation looking good,
                  everything else, not so good.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Today's thought: To the M’s starters, welcome to getting
                  “Felix’d”. Enjoy getting zero run support while pitching
                  decent or getting your win taken away by the bullpen if the
                  offense does score a run or two.
