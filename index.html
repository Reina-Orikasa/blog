                  Hello from the last day of October! While I‚Äôm too old to go out trick or treating now and too young to have kids to take trick or treating, it‚Äôs still fun to see the cool decorations people put outside their homes. And they‚Äôll soon transition to Christmas lights and other snowy decorations soon too. I saw some nice costumes while taking a walk outside, and I hope everyone stays safe while enjoying today.
                </p>

                <p>
                  On a related note, have you seen some of the new outfits in Azur Lane? I personally love how cute Erebus and Radford are.

                  I am a tad late here but let me extend my congratulations to the Dodgers for winning the World Series. r/formerMs Chris Taylor has more rings than the entire Mariners‚Äô franchise now. Feels bad man. Hopefully the Ms can match this in 2022 and beyond.

                  I also received my Pixel 5 on Thursday. Under closer inspection, I do notice a very small gap in the top-left corner of the phone. Similar to what many others are reporting over at the <a href="https://support.google.com/pixelphone/thread/77741994?hl=en ">Google Support Forums.</a>

                <p>Shoutout to my Animal Crossing villagers Angus, Bangle, and Pecan for giving me unlimited candy to feed the other villagers. Everyone else, I hate you all.</p>

                <p>Thanks for reading, and see you next time. (By the time this has been posted it‚Äôs not October 31st for you anymore huh?)</p>

                  Goodbye Houston. You tried, but you gotta be quicker than that!
                  I was hoping for a 4-0 Rays sweep, it almost happened, and then the Rays were almost on the short end of a reverse sweep. Did Pete Carroll take over the team or something? Cause these games aren‚Äôt good for me, yo.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Also congrats to the Dodgers and Dave Roberts for not choking game 7 to a city that has a history of choking. The 4th inning TOOTBLAN (Thrown Out On The Basepaths Like A Nincompoop) for the Braves sealed the deal in game 7 but failing to score with the bases loaded and 0 outs in game 6 is also a sinful crime (NOBLETIGER - No Outs Bases Loaded, Ending with Team Incapable of Getting Easy Run).

                </p>
                <p>
                  Rays vs. Dodgers is gonna be a fun series. Dodgers are similar to the Astros with an amazing offense (and not to mention Mookie Betts defense) facing the Rays bullpen that has shown some weaknesses in the series against the Astros. But the Dodgers‚Äô bullpen is no joke, either. Let‚Äôs see if Mike ‚ÄúFormerMs üçç‚Äù Zunino and some mf named Randy can keep smashing dingers and carry the flappy bois to a trophy.

              <h2>Flappy Bois Bandwagon / RIP Slam Diego Padres</h2>
              <p>October 11, 2020</p>
              <div>
                <p>
                  What a game 5. Fantastic pitching from both Cole and the Rays bullpen. In what almost feels like deja vu, Chapman ends up giving up the winning home run. Wait, haven‚Äôt we seen this before? Right, last year when the Astros walked off him in the 9th inning. But we all know how it turned out for the Astros. Lost in 7 versus the Nationals and soon exposed as cheaters. As a (lol)Mariners fan, it‚Äôs already pretty easy to hate on them, but now they will join Mike Trout in the hall of F*ck [insert player/team here]. No sympathy for cheaters, especially after the lackluster punishment handed down by Manfred and the lack of any real apology from the players.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Game 1 of the ALCS starts today. Although I want a 4-0 Rays sweep, it‚Äôll most likely be a close series since both teams have their strengths and weaknesses. Astros have the edge in terms of offense, while the Rays have a near-shutdown bullpen and ace starting pitchers as well. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  Unfortunately the Slam Diego Padres bandwagon wheels have fallen off. It has been a fun season watching them. Shame about the injuries to the starting pitching and Tatis/Machado disappearing though.

                <p>Looking forward to a great series on both the AL side and NL side. Rooting for the Flappy Bois (Rays) and Braves.</p>

                <p>In non-baseball related events, I wanted to talk about the upcoming Pixel 5. Yeah, the phone announced by Google nearly 2 weeks ago? I don‚Äôt blame you if you already forgot about the event or the phone. As it feels like Google themselves either didn‚Äôt have confidence in the phone or aren‚Äôt interested in selling them, since it feels like they spent a total of 5 minutes talking about the phone itself (they spent 7 minutes and 34 seconds). I‚Äôm conflicted about the pricing though ‚Äî as $699 is a reasonable price for something like the iPhone 11 which has the same SoC as the pro, 2 of the 3 cameras, and an LCD screen that is under 1080p. $699 for the Pixel 5 in the US compared to $599 elsewhere around the world just because of millimeter-wave 5G (mmWave) adding a $100 premium seems lousy, especially when the technology itself is very new and requires you to be almost next to the node itself to receive mmWave speeds (500 - 1,000+ Mbps).</p> See video: <span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1D6w-7Zav8">‚ÄúA Day On A 5G Phone: Fast, But Finicky‚Äù by MrMobile (Michael Fisher).</a>

                <p>The phone is being sold at $599 (approximately, after currency conversion) and European/UK buyers even get a free pair of Bose QC35II headphones, worth at least 200 Euros. Does Google not want US buyers to buy their phone this year? Should people wait another month for a potential Black Friday sale? Seems like a good idea to me, since the phones are not getting delivered until late October/early November if you preorder now.</p>

                <p>I must admit the green ‚ÄúSorta Sage‚Äù color does look nice.</p>

                  Hello October. And hello postseason baseball. Teams I‚Äôm rooting (bandwagoning) for: Tampa Bay Rays and Slam Diego Padres. Really good pitching from the aces for most teams. And an interesting divisional matchups for the ALDS and NLDS. AL East, AL West, NL East, and NL West teams facing each other. It will be interesting to see how teams adjust to the Bo5 series and which starting pitchers will be coming out of the bullpen in relief rather than just starting.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Song of the month: Wake Me Up When September Ends <br>
                  Pretty obvious choice huh? Another month gone by and the end of 2020 is just ahead. I personally feel like this year has gone by just as quickly as last, but I am sure that many will disagree considering how long we have been stuck in state where we can‚Äôt fully reopen but can‚Äôt do a full lockdown either. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  There are some exciting distractions not too far into the future for people who play video games. Cyberpunk 2077 is finally coming out in a month (Nov 19) after a few delays. You won‚Äôt hear any complains from me though. I will happily take a delayed game in exchange for a well-optimized game that has gone through rigorous QA testing to quash  as any bugs as possible. *Insert Miyamoto quote about delayed games here*

                <p>In other game-related updates, we are now two months away from the ‚Äúbiggest ever update for GTA Online‚Äù. I won‚Äôt speculate too much, but heists ‚Äúin an entirely new location‚Äù is something that everyone is talking about. Maybe a return a Liberty City? A new island off the coast of Los Santos? Only R* knows at this point. Looking forward to seeing more Newswire posts related to the update soon from Rockstar. Personally I look forward to the patch list of bugs that have been quashed‚Ä¶only for many more to be introduced. Unfortunately with how R* handles glitches and bugs, we‚Äôll have to wait for major updates for a large patch. Not going to talk about the wasteland that is known as PC Online as cheaters roam free and have been for a long while.</p>

                  Mariners show up for last game of the regular season, and still lose 2 - 6.
                  Season over. Final record: 27 - 33 and securing the 12th pick in the 2021 MLB Draft (according to www.tankathon.com/mlb). Ok, not exactly enough for FUBAR For Kumar, and just barely missing out on the 2nd place playoff spot in the AL West. Insert pain duck below.

                  On the bright side of things (both weather and Mariners), KLew4ROY is most likely gonna happen (.262/.364/.801 AVG/OBP/OPS) and next year will follow with Kelenic4ROY and MVP just like Ichiro did when he arrived in 2001. Taking the league by storm, ending the 19-year drought for postseason baseball in Seattle, and making it past the ALCS and ending more droughts. Coming soon to a TV close to you.

                  Can you believe it‚Äôs almost October? Another year is almost gone, but this time, I think that everyone will be celebrating when we say sayonara to 2020 and good morning to 2021. The coronavirus won‚Äôt disappear instantly, although it would be nice if it would just magically go poof as the clock hits midnight and the day turn to January 1st, 2021 around the world. Here‚Äôs some positive news: we will return to normal again. It will be safe again to travel the world, eat in restaurants with other people, and be able to attend events with people. Life is starting to return to many places in the world, and more will continue as countries gain a grasp on the coronavirus and the arrival of a safe and proven vaccine.

                  With a sprinkle of luck and good baseball, the city of Seattle may be celebrating more than just the return of the Seahawks. That, and the eventual dispersal of the wildfire smoke that has been choking the city for the past few days now. So bad that the series against the Giants has been moved to SF, although the Ms will play as the home team.

                  If anything, 2020 hasn‚Äôt exactly been the smoothest year in the world of baseball. Let‚Äôs recap some of the changes:
                </p>
                <p>- National League implements the DH</p>
                <p>- Positive coronavirus tests resulting in delayed games and doubleheaders. </p>
                <p>- Doubleheaders played in 7 innings</p>
                <p>- The home team playing in the away team‚Äôs stadium as the home team.</p>
                <p>- Shorter season and expanded playoffs system.</p>
                <p>
                  So yeah, things are different from normal. But that‚Äôs been the tagline for 2020 as a whole. Here‚Äôs the new normal, get used to it. But humans have survived much worse in the past. And we will continue to adapt and survive.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Next series: 2 vs. SF Giants in San Francisco as the home team. Crucial 3 game series against Houston next week.

              <h2>Vedder Cup Progress, Series Split, Trader Jerry, Coronavirus Postponement </h2>
              <p>September 3, 2020</p>

                <p>
                  In an almost unbelievable game, the bullpen manages to give up 7 runs in one inning and blowing the game completely to the Padres in game 1 of a doubleheader. Somehow I shouldn‚Äôt be surprised but I still am disappointed. However the team won the first game in the series and continued to win game 2 of the doubleheader, this time smacking a grand slam in the first inning en route to an 8 - 3 victory. Vedder Cup progress.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The series with the Angels started off rough. Losing a 1-run game in game one and two touchdowns in game two. However, the team recovered behind great starting pitching and a complete game to win games three and four by the score of 2 - 1 in both games. Starting pitching remaining sustainable will be key for the rest of the season. Along with clutch hitting with RISP the future is looking bright.
                </p>
                <p>Trader Jerry (Dipoto) made the trade deadline interesting, involving the team in a seven player deal. It‚Äôs awesome to see the team gain great prospects for a future push for glory. And I‚Äôm excited to see how these players will fit in with the team.</p>
                <p>
                  In the non-baseball related world, update 20.0 has released for Bloons TD 6. I have been playing with the new hero, Etienne, for a little bit now. I think the initial reaction describing him as someone that controls 0-0-0 dart monkeys until his global camo detection at level 8 kicks in and permanent UCAV at level 20 is pretty accurate. Better off as a support monkey rather than a full offensive one.

                  After losing 3 out of 4 to the Dodgers, the M‚Äôs complete a 3
                  game sweep of the Rangers. The word on the street? Kyle Lewis
                  (and the name Kyle). But also how about that starting pitching
                  and bullpen? The bullpen only gave up 1 (!!) run in the 3 game
                  series. We‚Äôll have to see if this remains sustainable, but
                  from the 3 games things are looking good, at least for the
                  future. Indeed, the future looks exciting, even if the team
                  misses out on Kumar Rocker.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Ideally, this season would be a major success if our youth

                  a bad filler update with QOL (quality of life) updates. The

                <p>
                  Again, the team seems to be confused on whether they should be
                  FUBAR for Kumar or chasing one of those expanded postseason
                  slots. Record: 7-13 and currently the 3rd worst team in the
                  league by win percentage. Another week, starting pitching
                  looking good, offense shifting between scoring runs and
                  getting shutout, and bullpen being the blowpen.

                  Looking on the somewhat bright side, Mariners baseball has
                  returned. 12 games through, a 4-8 record and a team that
                  doesn't know whether it wants to end the 18-year postseason
                  drought or FUBAR for Kumar. Starting rotation looking good,
                  everything else, not so good.

                  Today's thought: To the M‚Äôs starters, welcome to getting
                  ‚ÄúFelix‚Äôd‚Äù. Enjoy getting zero run support while pitching
                  decent or getting your win taken away by the bullpen if the
                  offense does score a run or two.
